// Single quotes ('') are a fundamental method for creating strings in JavaScript?
// double quotes ("") are a fundamental method for creating strings in JavaScript?

//In JavaScript, single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") work exactly the same for creating stringsâ€”
// you just need to use the same type of quote at the start and end.
//  The main difference is that using one type lets you easily include the other type 
// inside the string without adding backslashes. For example, use single quotes if your 
// string has double quotes inside, and double quotes if your string has single quotes. 
// Other than that, they behave identically.

let finalstring = string1 + " " + string2 + " " + string3;
