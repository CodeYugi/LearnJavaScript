// console.log("hello world");

// code => Code is the language used to communicate with computers.
// running code => Compilation/Interpretation -> Loding -> Execution -> output 

// Java script is  interpreted language 

// what that means ? interpreted or compile 

// Compilation => in this computer take your code and convert into machine lang 0 and 1
//                then execute  your code........

// interpreter => in this computer convert the code line by line to 0 and 1s and then execute
//                rather than doing it once like compile lang

//Fact
// Compiled languages are faster because they translate the whole code into machine language
// (0s and 1s) just once before running the program. This machine code runs directly 
// on the computerâ€™s hardware without extra work. On the other hand, 
// interpreted languages read and execute the code line-by-line every time you run the program,
// which takes extra time because the interpreter has to translate the code repeatedly.
// So, compiling takes more time upfront but makes the program run faster, 
// while interpreting is slower because it does the translation over and 
// over during execution.

// Syntax ?

// what is syntax ? => Syntax refers to the rules that must be followed when writing code.
//                     syntax is  Case Sensitive , semicolan placement....
