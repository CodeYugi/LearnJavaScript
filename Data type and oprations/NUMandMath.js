// Data type and operations 

// # Number And Math 
// -> Don't take  stress about let and console.log by the that is for show output in console

let a = 1; // giving value to a 
let b = 2; // giving value to b
// lets found addition , substraction ,  multiplication , division of a and b 
let add = a + b; 
let sub = a - b;
let multi = a * b;
let div =  b / a;
console.log(add ,  sub , multi , div);

// as you see  + for addition  , - for substraction , * for multiplication
// and /  for division like this for remainder we use %
// for assining a value we use = 

// lets list them all 

// (1)=> += 
// if we need to add a value to  any variable oh it is simple by declaring other variable 

let firstvar = 6;
let finalvar = firstvar + 4;
console.log(finalvar); // to check the output in console 
// perfect but there is also another way to do this =>
let secondvar = 6; 
// now i want to add 4 to secondvar means 6 so 
secondvar += 4;
console.log(secondvar); // for same reason as before 
// shortcut easy way or nice way to make it happen 

// this is not only for addition 
// multiplication *=
// Division /=
// substraction -=

// two more ++ and --
// ++ This is an even shorter shortcut specifically for increasing a variable's value by one
// -- This  Decreases a variable's value by one

// try by yourself once  and check out put on console using console.log

// keep in mind they use BODMAS priroty

// two types of number 
let firsttype = 1; // integer (whole number)
let secondtype = 2.3; // Floats 
// float have minor inaccuracy because computer store value in 0 and 1

// Math.round()
let round = Math.round(2.876);

console.log(round);
